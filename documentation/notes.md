Exploration/Questions/Hypothesis
================================

- Comparing collections - same works of art in different collections 
- Frequencies of works by artist by collection
- Exploring the different representation of works of are across collections
- Moving through collections and grabbing art market prices where available (average prices? Going to be difficult since this data is pretty well locked down behind paywalls, and has a limited historical range)
- Tracking, repurposing art that falls withing the category of "[database aesthetics](http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/database-aesthetics)."
- Linked Data for artworks (making apparent the history underlying a work of art.)
- Computational Art History
